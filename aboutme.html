    <h3> I'm from Mexico but I came to the US looking for adventure and looking for my dream job in 2020, yep right before covid hit so nothing worked as I planed as you could imagine. Finally this year I started studying to be a software developer wanting to learn and reach my always moving and growing dreams and ambitions. </h3>
    <h3>So far I've learned basic/advance HTML and CSS, keep intouch with me and we can enjoy this learning journey together</h3></br></br>
